# PCB Business Card KiCad Project

The goal of this project is to make a PCB the size and thickness of a business card that has a built in ATtiny85 MCU
that is powered over a USB connection. 

Rev1.0 Goals: Generic Dev board, I want to be able to program the MCU on the board itself, and toggle some LEDs
Rev2.0 Goals: Ideally should be able to communicate over the USB connection, either by acting as a USB device or a terminal of sorts.
Rev3.0 Goals: Make "business" presentable (silk screen, cool LED pattern, create interface that links to personal website / linked in)
Rev4.0 Goals: Use this as a platform for other cool projects (embedded Linux, RISCV, games, etc.)
